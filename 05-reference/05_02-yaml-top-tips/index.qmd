![](top_tips-cj-dayrit-LSKsYHGj4rI-unsplash.jpg){style="height: 300px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: 50% 20%;"}

Took me a while to work out how to style an image :( 
  
I do it like this now: 

``` Markdown
![](top_tips-cj-dayrit-LSKsYHGj4rI-unsplash.jpg){style="height: 300px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: 50% 20%;"}
```

I found that Quarto doesn't seem to translate/process HTML when it is rendering. So if I call the image from inside HTML text like below,

``` HTML
<div style=		
    "background-image: url(portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg);
    width: 100%;
    height: 400px;
    background-position: 50% 40%;
    background-size: cover;">
</div>
```

then the image referenced in the HTML was not recognised by Quarto and so wasn't carried through into the rendered HTML version and so it failed to display.

To solve this I called the image in simple markdown, but managed to apply CSS styling too. Here it is again

``` Markdown
![](portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg){style="height: 400px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;"}
```

For some reason having 

``` yaml
jupyter: python3
```

in the Yaml causes Quarto to make a '_files' folder mirroring the file/folder with the jupyter: python3 Yaml in. This mirror folder contains execute files, probably letting Quarto know what to run in python or something. Essentially, I am a bit unsure about this Yaml.

To add citations you can type @ reference id, like this @xie2015...

The references, including the id, are stored in a references.bib file.

To write in the margin you can make a div like so

``` markdown
::: {.column-margin}

Stuff you can write in the margin

![A margin image](website-tutorial_sam-mcghee-KieCLNzKoBo-unsplash.jpg)

:::
```

::: {.column-margin}

I got comments working using [https://www.joelnitta.com/](https://www.joelnitta.com/)'s website.

GitHub here [https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/main/_quarto.yml](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/main/_quarto.yml)

And this is a footnote, or extra bit of content[^1]^[and some inline footnote stuff]

[^1]: Some longer form content
    
    which you can put into a footnote

    is that cool?
