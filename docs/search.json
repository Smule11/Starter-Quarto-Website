    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Quarto?\nQuarto is the most recent website creation tool, but has risen to become one of the most popular, in large part due to the reputation of the team making it. It is a website template tool, so you write in markdown (with a YAML header) and then you make Quarto render your markdown files into the website’s HTML.\nAll Quarto does is turn your Markdown files into HTML files, the format of which can be tweaked by the optional associated YAML header, telling Quarto how to decorate the webpages.\nThe YAML header controls the layout of the page. On each page in the template there will be a </> button, to reveal what the underlying Markdown+YAML source file is pre-Quarto conversion into HTML, if you so wished to know!\nWhile there is a bit of a learning curve, using template website builders like Quarto is easier than making your own website and looks more professional and is super fast once you get used to it. Having looked around Quarto seems to do a decent job blending these facets to give you the best experience in terms of simplicity, speed, flexibility and quality.\n\n\nWhat is this starter website?\nThe point of this website is as a more “feature rich” template.\nThe main Quarto website is also feature rich, and a good source of insipration, but I thought it would be easier to have this website as a starting point, so you can copy this website to your own repo as explained below, as explained below, to get a more feature rich website out of the blocks.\nYou can publish this website using GitHub pages, or on other platforms, see here.\n\n\nWhy should I have a website?\n\nDocumenting what you have read, learnt and thought online is useful for yourself and others.\nHaving a website where you can showcase yourself and your portfolio makes you stand out to employers (as does being active on GitHub, which writing on this website will make you appear).\nAs alluded to before, there is a small initial learning curve, before the process becomes fast. But the skills required are mainstream and highly useful (e.g. GitHub, Markdown, HTML).\n\n\n\nQuick way to get your own website up and running in 3 minutes two steps!\nAssuming you have a GitHub account that is:\n\nFork this repo (in the top right) of this page to make your own website repository.\nGo into the settings of your new website repo, and edit the settings for “Pages” (on the middle left somewhere):\nUnder ‘build and deployment’, select branch=main and folder=/docs. Then your website should go live!\n\n\n\n\ngithub pages settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how to edit the files…\nThis process has a couple of steps, but you need to edit it locally on your computer and render the markdown with Quarto, then push the files back up to GitHub.\nYou will need to have Quarto and Git installed on your computer and linked to your GitHub.\nIn short:\n\nthen download your github repo containing your website to your local computer.\n\nThen you can edit the markdown files in a markdown (.md / .qmd) or notebook (.ipynb) editor of your choice.\n\nConvert the markdown files into the HTML files, using Quarto.\nRun “quarto render the_file_path_of_your_website_directory” in a terminal (or use the shortcut in VS Code / Jupyter Notebook if you have the relevant Quarto extension).\nPush this local repository back up to the GitHub repository where your GitHub pages website is stored, using Git.\n\n\n\nAdvanced\nYou can also add javascript into your Quarto webpage, linked through the YAML header, to customise the webpage further. See here.\n\n\nUseful links\nSetting up Git and GitHub Quarto Guide"

    "text": "Here I summarise the Quarto docs, saying which bits were useful to me…\n\n\n\nAuthoring - Markdown basics\n::: content ::: -> <div> <p> content </p> <div>\n\n\nAsking CHATGPT about this notation…\n\n\n\nME: do you know what ::: is? Maybe related to markdown.\nCHATGPT: The “:::” is often used in markdown as a way to create a horizontal rule, which is a line that separates content on a webpage or document. It is used to visually break up sections of content and make them easier to read. It is supported by many markdown parsers and can be used in many different platforms like Github, Jupyter notebook, etc.\nME: is it related to breaks between cells in notebooks?\nCHATGPT: No, the “:::” is not typically used to indicate breaks between cells in notebooks. Notebooks, such as Jupyter, use specific syntax to separate code cells, such as using “—” or “***” in markdown cells or using “#%%” in code cells.\nIt’s not a standard syntax, but some people use it as a way to separate cells in jupyter notebook but it is not officially supported and different from the standard way which is using the command “—” or “***” in markdown cell or using “#%%” in code cells.\n\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n\nAuthoring - Article Layout\n\n.column-body-outset\n.column-page-inset\n.column-page\n.column-screen-inset\n.column-screen\n\n\n\n\nalso can put direction on the end -right or -left.\nUsing the margin:\n\ncan put footnotes, citations and asides in the margin too.\ncan also put like figures and stuff in the margin.\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html\n\n\nNavigation\n\nOverview\nTop Navigation\nSide Navigation\nHybrid Navigation\nPage Navigation\nPage Footer\nHiding Navigation\nReader Mode\nSite Search\nGitHub Links\nRedirects\n404 Pages\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html\n\n\nDocument Listings (make a structured list of things on a web page)\n\nListing Contents (a whole folder, or specific files/folders)\nListing Options\n\nDefault\nGrids\nTables\n\nUser Tools\n\nSorting dropdown\nFiltering dropdown\nPagination (showing a finite number pf posts at once and splitting the list of posts over multiple pages)\n\nListing Location (e.g. listing sandwiched between texts)\n\nMultiple Listings\n\nListing Fields (e.g. [image, date, title, author, reading-time])\n\nCustomizing Fields\n\nListing Sorting and Tags\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html\n\n\nExtra on Listings\n\nListing templates (In addition to the 3 built in types of listings can make custom listings)\nDealing with listing metadata and customising it\nPoints to the gallery to show examples of quarto websites\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings-custom.html\n\n\nPage Layout\n\npage-layout (article, full, custom)\n\nin custom, can make grid with different column widths\n\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/page-layout.html#custom\n\n\nThemes\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html\n\n\nExtra Website Things\n\nHeaders & Footers\nSocial Metadata\nGoogle Analytics\nCookie Consent\nSite Resources\nDark Mode\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html\n\n\nHow .yml files and headers combine\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html\n\n\nProcessing foreign notebooks into a good format\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/extensions/nbfilter.html\n\n\nInteractivity (e.g. sliders on plots)\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/interactive/"

    "text": "Try to avoid using HTML code in your markdown, only because Quarto won’t read the HTML when it is rendering. And Quarto will only carry through things into the rendered/previewed version if they are read by Quarto.\nAs an example, I chose to style an image in the markdown, using HTML:\n<div style=     \n    \"background-image: url(portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg);\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 400px;\n    background-position: 50% 40%;\n    background-size: cover;\">\n</div>\nbut the image was not carried through into the rendered version so failed to display.\nTo solve this I called the image in simple markdown, but managed to apply inline CSS styling too.\n![](portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg){style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;\"}"
